        "1.   All columns in the current data set must be preserved. It is not necessary to preserve any of the actual data from the current database\n",

        "3.   The database should keep track of the languages (other than English) spoken by each employee. Each employee speaks 0, 1 or 2 languages in addition to English.\n",
        "4.  To grow, the company plans to sponsor visas and hire non-USA citizens. So your synthetic database should include 40% employees who are non-USA citizens and should include names of employees from India, Mainland China, Canada, South Korea, Philippines, Taiwan and Mexico. These names should be in proportion to the 2019 percentages of H1B petitions from each country.\n",
        "5.   The expanded company will have additional departments include “Legal” (approximately 5% of employees), “Marketing” (10%), “Administrative” (10%), “Operations” (20%), “Sales” (10%), “Finance” (5%) and “I/T” (10%) to go along with the current “Product” (20%) and “Human Resource” (10%) departments.\n",
        "6.  Salaries in each department must mimic the typical salaries for professionals in each field. You can find appropriate data for each type of profession at salary.com For example, see this page to find a model estimate for your synthetic marketing department: https://www.salary.com/research/salary/benchmark/marketing-specialist-salary.\n",
